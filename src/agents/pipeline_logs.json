Provide:\n   - risk_score: 0-100 score\n   - reasoning: 2-3 sentences explaining the score\n   - confidence: \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\"\n\nBe objective and data-driven.

Analyze the metrics to determine narrative strength and media saturation\n2. Calculate a narrative score from 0-100 using the full range:\n   - 0-20: Minimal coverage (0-5 articles, no tier-1 outlets, neutral sentiment)\n   - 21-40: Low coverage (6-20 articles, 1-3 tier-2 outlets, mixed sentiment)\n   - 41-60: Moderate coverage (21-50 articles, some tier-2, positive trend)\n   - 61-80: High coverage (51-120 articles, multiple tier-1, strong positive sentiment)\n   - 81-100: Media saturation (120+ articles, dominant tier-1, overwhelmingly positive)\n\n3. Consider:\n   - News volume (article count in 3-month window from graph)\n   - Real-time coverage (last 30 days from web search)\n   - Freshness score (narrative acceleration indicator)\n   - Outlet tier distribution (tier 1 = Industry Authority/Financial Authority)\n   - Average sentiment (-1.0 to +1.0 scale)\n\n4. Freshness Score Interpretation (KEY METRIC):\n   - <0.5: Coverage declining (interest waning) \u2192 LOWER score\n   - 0.5-1.5: Stable coverage (normal pattern) \u2192 Use base metrics\n   - 1.5-3.0: Accelerating coverage (growing buzz) \u2192 INCREASE score +10-20 points\n   - >3.0: Spiking coverage (PEAK hype signal) \u2192 INCREASE score +20-40 points (PEAK indicator)\n\n5. Scoring guidelines - use the full scale based on data:\n   - If news_count = 0: Score 0-10\n   - If news_count 1-10 and tier1_count = 0: Score 10-25\n   - If news_count 10-30 and tier1_count < 3: Score 25-45\n   - If news_count 30-80 or tier1_count >= 3: Score 45-70\n   - If news_count > 80 or tier1_count >= 6: Score 70-95\n   - Then ADJUST based on freshness score (see #4 above)\n\n6. Provide:\n   - narrative_score: 0-100 score (adjusted for freshness)\n   - reasoning: 2-3 sentences explaining the score (mention freshness if significant)\n   - confidence: \"high\", \"medium\", or \"low\"\n\nBe objective and data-driven. Use the full 0-100 scale based on the actual metrics.\n\nNOTE: Very high scores (>70) + high freshness (>3.0) = PEAK hype saturation (contrarian signal).\n\nTechnology: advanced_air_mobility\n\nMetrics (Historical - Graph):\n- News articles (6mo): 20\n- Tier 1 outlets: 0\n- Tier 2 outlets: 0\n- Tier 3 outlets: 0\n- Avg sentiment: 0.00\n- Sentiment trend: neutral\n\nMetrics (Real-Time - Tavily):\n- Articles found: 20 (raw search results)\n- Relevant articles: 12 (60% relevance)\n- Relevance note: Out of the 20 articles, 12 specifically focus on Advanced Air Mobility, discussing its developments, applications, and challenges in detail.

Therefore, the score reflects moderate adoption with room for growth."
