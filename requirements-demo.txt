# ============================================================================
# DEMO MODE DEPENDENCIES - Minimal Render.com Deployment
# ============================================================================
# What Render.com needs to run read-only API with Neo4j graph visualization
# No multi-agent execution, no pipeline runs, no OpenAI costs
#
# This file contains ONLY the dependencies needed for demo deployment:
# - Neo4j graph visualization endpoints
# - Pre-generated chart display
# - Historical run browsing
# - Health checks
#
# For full pipeline execution with multi-agent system, use requirements.txt
# ============================================================================

# 1. FastAPI Web Framework (Required for API server)
fastapi>=0.115.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.32.0

# 2. Neo4j Database (Required for graph visualization)
neo4j>=5.25.0

# 3. Data Validation (Required by FastAPI)
pydantic>=2.10.0
pydantic-settings>=2.6.0

# 4. Configuration (Required for environment variables)
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# 5. HTTP Client (Required by Neo4j async operations)
