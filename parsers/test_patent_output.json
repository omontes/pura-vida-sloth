    "summary": "",
    "content": "A rotor assembly deployment mechanism configured to deploy a rotor assembly of a vertical take-off and landing aircraft from a horizontal, forward thrust, position to a vertical, hover, position. The rotor assembly deployment mechanism is configured to deploy an electric motor and propeller together. The deployment mechanism provides significant stiffness and strength with the use of torsion box constructions. The deployment mechanism may utilize bar linkages wherein the primary linkage pivot is of a large diameter relative to the span of the pivot in order to provide significant stiffness. The deployment mechanism may utilize rotary actuators to drive the deployment and stowing of the rotor assembly.",
