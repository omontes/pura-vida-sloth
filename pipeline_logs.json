The technology is in a hype phase, indicated by a perfect hype score of 100/100, suggesting that while interest is high, practical implementation and financial viability remain uncertain. The divergence in layer scores, particularly the low risk score of 20/100, indicates potential financial instability and a lack of solid contracts or revenue streams to support the current enthusiasm.",
